Hello! This is just a little something I'm trying to make (as I learn) to help me in my future plugin development.

If you want to use this, you can import it by using what's below!

    <repository>
      <id>jitpack.io</id>
      <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>

    <dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.jordqubbe</groupId>
	    <artifactId>Extras</artifactId>
	    <version>v0.1.2-HotFix</version>
     </dependency>
